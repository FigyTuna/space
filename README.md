##Space game!

This game is pretty much finished.

I'm gonna fine tune things later.

Some things I should add:
	Each token gives an ability to help with getting other tokens:
		Compass.
		Proximity sensor.
		Coordinates.
		arrow size.
	Fine tune different speeds for different distances clicked.
	Think about broken pushing system.
	More landmarks.
	Bad guys? NPCs?
